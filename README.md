This project demonstrates the computation process of the RWKV (Receptance Weighted Key Value) model through Excel spreadsheets. By manually implementing the model's core components, you can gain a deeper understanding of RWKV's internal mechanisms, particularly its innovative TimeMix and ChannelMix approaches.

## RWKV-7
[RWKV-7](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14456) "Goose" ü™ø is 100% RNN and a meta-in-context learner, efficiently test-time-training its state on the context via in-context gradient descent at every token in parallel.
